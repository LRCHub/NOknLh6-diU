It may sound crazy
Crazy what i say
But i hid it in my soul

I can be an animal
Trapped in a cage eh, eh, eh eh, of my zoo

I break the barriers dancing to escape
From my own zoo
I'm struggling with my truth

My skin can be sotf
But i can have sharp ah, ah, ah, ah, sharp claws

I break the barriers dancing to escape
From my own zoo

I'm struggling with my truth
I'm struggling with my truth
I'm struggling with my truth
