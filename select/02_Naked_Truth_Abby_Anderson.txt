Your number's in my busted phone
And I'm sitting here all alone
Maybe it's just better
That I can't get a hold of you
And ask the naked truth

'Cause you've been lying
I've been crying
But I've wasted my last tear, go

You've been dirty dancing
Getting busy with the whole romancing
Sticking round this time
Doing things you are not to do
Yeah baby that's the naked truth
Whoa-oh, on her Instagram
She never shoulda posted that with my man
And I'm glad to know that, boy
Now I win and you lose
And so I'm second
That's the naked truth

So I tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna let that girl have you
You think that you're the bomb, so honey
Let me light up this fuse, yeah
And that's the naked truth
Hey, hey

'Cause you've been dirty dancing
Getting busy with the whole romancing
Sticking round this time
Doing things you are not to do
Yeah baby that's the naked truth
Whoa-oh, on her Instagram
She never shoulda posted that with my man
And I'm glad to know that, boy
Now I win and you lose
And so I'm second
That's the naked truth
Oh yeah

Gone up to mountains
Took a long look around, yeah
I've seen my future
And there ain't no, no, no sign of you, no
And that's the naked truth, oh yeah

Getting busy with the whole romancing
Sticking round this time
Doing things you are not to do
Yeah baby that's the naked truth
Whoa-oh, on her Instagram
She never shoulda posted that with my man
And I'm glad to know that, boy
Now I win and you lose
So long, sucker
That's the naked truth
Oh yeah
Now I win and you lose
Oh yeah, baby
That's the naked truth
Yeah that's the naked truth
Yeah baby, ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
