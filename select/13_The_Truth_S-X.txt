You can't handle the truth and that's why I don't tell it to you
I'll let you know I got you and then if it not get it for you
Stuck in the middle of happiness and negativity yeah
No more swag but I'll ride it out because I'm sticking with you
I wanna know when we're taking off 'cause I'm coming with you
I get down when you're not around because I fucking miss you
I get down when you come around because I miss you, girl

You can't handle the truth and that's why I don't tell it to you

Stuck in the middle of happiness and negativity yeah
No more swag but I'll ride it out because I'm sticking with you
I wanna know when we're taking off 'cause I'm coming with you
