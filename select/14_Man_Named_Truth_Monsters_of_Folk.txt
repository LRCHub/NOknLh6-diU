Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
I'll tell you right now that it ain't no use
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Pain was a-huntin' me down but I gave him the slip
I left the city through the tunnel and i headed for the sticks
With oregano oil and a morphine drip
Pain was hunting me down but I gave him the slip
then I fell in love with identical twins
They lived 34 summers between the two of them
I gave one my ego, I gave one my id
Yeah, I gotta get back to my pretty little twins
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
I'll tell you right now that it ain't no use
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
I was lost for a year in those almond trees
The sun was rising in south and setting in the east
I was half-awake, I was half-asleep
I thought I'd never get out of those almond trees
So don't think too slow in the syrupy sun
You get buried alive when you're caught up in the cold (?)
Tapping your time on a congo drum
Don't think too slow in the syrupy sun
I met a black-skinned man with a ice cream grin
and a blond afghan with that heroin
we moved to the mountains where the highway ends
and I got myself that ice cream grin
So don't search too long for that Aztec gold
Like gold Cortez, gonna lose your soul
turn an honest man into Diablo
Don't trade your soul for no Aztec gold
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Never buy nothin' from a man named truth
Look in my eyes and you see the proof
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
Don't ever buy nothin' from a man named truth
