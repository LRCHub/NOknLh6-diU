Apart, I knew we couldn't do it
We're on a wheel of misfortune
It's true that I wasn't certain
Another one who fought to
Keep things finished,
Cause I think it's stupid that we're indifferent,
And it's all done, but

Not everything's useful
Cause I'm stuck, at drawing the line

We're not gonna steal away
We're gonna get mute
Stuck up in a rut, to ease
The very short truth
Surrounding our sight with my sole view,
I'm counting the nights till I hold you
Nothings gonna be okay,
It's not a clean bruise
Something in my gut, stops me
To say I need proof
Whatever alignment we're thrown to,
I'm never deciding our own use

I know your old contemplations
Can make you apprehensive
So sure that every bit wasted
Will end up more suppressive
Now we've older
And we've just got closer to what we suffered,
And it's all wrong, but

Not everything's easy
Cause I suck, at seeing the signs

We're not gonna steal away
We're gonna get mute
Stuck up in a rut, to ease
The very short truth
Surrounding our sight with my sole view,
I'm counting the nights till I hold you
Nothings gonna be okay,
It's not a clean bruise
Something in my gut, stops me
To say I need proof
Whatever alignment we're thrown to,
I'm never deciding our own use

We're not gonna steal away
We're gonna get mute
Stuck up in a rut, to ease
The very short truth
Surrounding our sight with my sole view,
I'm counting the nights till I hold you
Nothings gonna be okay,
It's not a clean bruise
Something in my gut, stops me
To say I need proof
Whatever alignment we're thrown to,
I'm never deciding our own use

I'm only gonna mess us round
It's just that I could never go again
I know how this is ending out
But if I could, I wouldn't go alone
I'm only gonna bring you down
L thought that you would always be a friend
I know I never gave enough
And that I wouldn't have to say

I can't even see this right
If I can't be in your life
Themes nothing I'd use, to resort to
I'm giving this up, to console you

We're not gonna steal away
We're gonna get mute
Stuck up in a rut, to ease
The very short truth
Surrounding our sight with my sole view,
I'm counting the nights till I hold you
Nothings gonna be okay,
It's not a clean bruise
Something in my gut, stops me
To say I need proof
Whatever alignment we're thrown to,
I'm never deciding our own use
